# React-Redux-Isomorphic-Starter

## Introduction
This is a repository that I made to be used as a starting point for any React
application. To view the starting point, go to the following directory:

src/client/components/homepage

This is the location of the text you will see once you start up the app.

You may be wondering why Babel and Webpack are declared as dependencies rather
than developer dependencies

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get set up:

- npm i
- Open up three seperate terminal windows
- npm run build
- npm run webpack
- npm run start:dev

If you leave these processes running, webpack and babel will compile a new version
of your application and you can see the changes you've made without having to run
these commands again.

## Technologies
This project includes the following technologies that you can take advantage of:

- Axios
- Postcss
- React
- Redux
- React-Redux
- React-Router
- Redux-Logger
